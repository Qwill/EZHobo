# EZHobo
Welcome to Ezhobo, your one stop shop for all things Hobopolis automation scripting and the basis of the Ascension Speed Society's Feeding (on) the Homeless Initiative. In order to run out of the box, the following things are required:

A Porquoise-handled sixgun

A Hobo Code Binder w/17+ glyphs (15 will work for coat runs)

Either the CLEESH spell available and/or access to free runs (For Hamster runs)

Stuffed Mortar Shell

Flavor of Magic

The ability to coordinate and work with others


Before running, you should also make sure to have an outfit with the word "hobo" in it, in which you overkill Town Square hobos in


After everything is installed and set up, operation is simple. 


Step 1: Bait your cage. We here at the Initiative sugggest utilizing ASSBot (#3562551) for all your caging needs

  Step 1a: /msg ASSBot status

  Step 1b. /msg ASSBot cage [clan name]

Step 2: In the Mafia gcli line, type "Ezhobo [stick/coat/hamster] [###] where stick/coat/hamster is the type of run you are attempting and ### is the number of turns to spend.


"But what does it do?" you may ask. 

"Hopbopolis." I say.

Ezhobo will...

Clear the sewers in the most efficient manner for your run, accounting for water level and grates as appropriate. It will restock your sewer items, and take you from beginning to end of the maze.

Then it will mercilessly beat up hobos in town square for a bit, creating scobos of their various remains every set of 7 parts. From here...

Ezhobo stick will clear the side zones except for the AHBG, cause that place sucks.

Ezhobo coat will claer EE and BB for those extra delicious Frosty Mugs and Salad Forks.

Ezhobo hamster will mercilessly destroy town square hobos and take you directly to Hodgman. 


To Do:

- Ezhobo Stick - PLD and Heap suppoert to be added before "ezhobo stick" works

- Ezhobo hamster is not fully a thing yet. 

- EE yodelling needs to be tweaked (possibly? Acted funny on 27May23 Hodgman run in CDR1)
 

Latest craze, easy Ezhobo installation!
